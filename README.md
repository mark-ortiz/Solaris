Hi there,

Welcome to the repo, this is intended to share some scripts I have developed or modified for Solaris.\
Some scripts are pretty simple but very helpful.\
Greetings to everybody, enjoy!.

NOTAS / NOTES:\
Repo para scripts de Solaris que he realizado en Gitronic/Gibitnet para facilitar el trabajo.\
This repo contains some basic scripts for making things easier when administering some Solaris host.\
As always, you will have to modify some things for your environment but pretty straitforward.

Script --- What does it do?

<pre>
alarma-de-monitoreo.sh  Monitors server temperature using IPMItool, sends mail if threshold is triggered
aliasutiles.sh          Stablish some useful alias so you don't have to type a lot\
aliasutiles_users.sh    Same as before but for users\
detalleluns.sh          Lists the luns present in a Solaris system, very useful for listing "disks" from storage systems\
detallelunsv2.sh        Lists the luns but with much more detail, sometimes needed for troubleshooting\
env_vars_oracle.sh      For stablishing some environment variables when installing Oracle Database\
montar_software.sh      For mounting windows shared folders\
mantto.sh               Script for performing logical maintenance to a Solaris host, this is the most useful (I think)\
maquinas.sh             This is used to list if there are VirtualBox machines in the system (running or not)\
monitoreo.sh            Used for monitoring memopry and zfs disk pools\
prereq_18c_sparc.sh     For preparing a host to install Oracle DB version 18c\
set_user_reserve.sh     Script original from Oracle to set memory in Solaris hosts.\
swapinfo.sh             For knowing what is using swap.\
verswap.sh              Works together with swapinfo.sh
